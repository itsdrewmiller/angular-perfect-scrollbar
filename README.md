angular-perfect-scrollbar
=========================

This is a small directive to allow the use of perfect-scrollbar (https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar) in angular.

You can just use the file (in the *src* directory) as is - you only need to pay attention to the other stuff for further development.
