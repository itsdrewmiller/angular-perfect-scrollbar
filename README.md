### Note For This Forked Repo
This project is a forked repo by [angular-perfect-scrollbar](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar), since author maintain it inactively, we need fix some bugs and add some available features, so publish this repo to bower "angular-live-scrollbar"

This is a small directive to allow the use of [perfect-scrollbar](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar) in angular.

You can just use the file (in the *src* directory) as is - you only need to pay attention to the other stuff for further development.  It is also available on [Bower](http://bower.io) as 'angular-perfect-scrollbar'.

Installation
=========================

Install via Bower:

```shell
$ bower install angular-perfect-scrollbar --save
```

Include the angular-perfect-scrollbar files in your index.html:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/perfect-scrollbar/min/perfect-scrollbar.min.css" />
<script src="bower_components/perfect-scrollbar/min/perfect-scrollbar.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/perfect-scrollbar/min/perfect-scrollbar.with-mousewheel.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-perfect-scrollbar/src/angular-perfect-scrollbar.js"></script>
```

Include some css for your scrollable content:

```css
.scroller {
    white-space: pre-line;
    height: 500px;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    position: relative;
}
```

Add it as module to your app.js:

```js
['perfect_scrollbar']
```

Use it wherever you want:

```html
<perfect-scrollbar class="scroller" wheel-propagation="true" wheel-speed="10" min-scrollbar-length="20">
  // your content
</perfect-scrollbar>
```
