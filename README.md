angular-perfect-scrollbar
=========================

This is a small directive to allow the use of [perfect-scrollbar](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar) in AngularJS.

You can just use one of the files (in the *src* directory) as they are - you only need to pay attention to the other stuff for further development. It is also available from [Bower](http://bower.io) as 'angular-perfect-scrollbar'.

Installation
------------

Install via Bower:

```shell
$ bower install angular-perfect-scrollbar --save
```

Include the angular-perfect-scrollbar files in your index.html:

```html
<link href="bower_components/perfect-scrollbar/css/perfect-scrollbar.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="bower_components/perfect-scrollbar/js/perfect-scrollbar.jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-perfect-scrollbar/src/angular-perfect-scrollbar.js"></script>
```

Include some CSS for your scrollable content:

```css
.scroller {
    white-space: pre-line;
    height: 500px;
    overflow-y: hidden;
    position: relative;
}
```

Inject the module into your app or component:

```js
['perfect_scrollbar']
```

Use it wherever you want with the custom directive:

```html
<perfect-scrollbar class="scroller" wheel-propagation="true" wheel-speed="10" min-scrollbar-length="20">
  <!-- Your content here. -->
</perfect-scrollbar>
```

Further installation and usage hints can be found at https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar.

You can find simple vertical and horizontal examples in the *examples* folder in this repository.  Much respect to [Hyunje Jun](https://github.com/noraesae) for his great scrollbar library.
